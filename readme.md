# Nodejs-Graphql-Project-

This is a Online Learning Management Sysytem which is made up on GraphQl.


## Why Nodejs-graphQl 🤔

- GraphQL can be used with many different programming languages and platforms, and can be used in both server-side and client-side applications. It's commonly used with Node.js,  but there are also GraphQL implementations available for other languages like Python, Ruby, and Java.

- With GraphQL, clients can specify exactly what data they need, and the server can respond with only that data, eliminating over-fetching and under-fetching of data. This makes API responses more efficient, reducing the amount of data transferred between client and server, and improving overall performance.

- Overall, GraphQL provides a more efficient and flexible way to build APIs, allowing developers to focus on building applications rather than worrying about data fetching and management.

- Git clone -> npm install -> project is ready to use.
